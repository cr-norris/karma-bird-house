### We always went up to find our best inspiration, so we built a box on the roof where we could bring big projects and ideas to life.

The Roof Space is a fully outfitted 25-person conference room with a beautiful panoramic view of Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. Complete with a small kitchenette, all your A/V needs, a break-out work room, coffee and pastry catering service from Maglianero, and a private bathroom; the Roof Space is an awe inspiring place to host your next meeting or conference. Specifics include: 

* A sink and mini-fridge
* A 60" 4K LCD display
* Surround sound audio
* HDMI and VGA
* Break-out work room with table and chairs
