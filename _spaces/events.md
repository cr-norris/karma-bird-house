### Over 20 years of hosting, planning, and running events with our friends we've seen these historic spaces support a spectrum of functions and needs. From the practical to the imaginative, we're always curious and excited to see what comes next.

Need space? Our available spaces include:

* **Maglianero Cafe &  Karma Bird House Gallery:** a flexible 1,200 square foot window-lined space which commonly hosts larger functions like community events, weddings, product launches, talks and lectures. With on-street access, tons of natural light, wood floors, and a vaulted ceiling.
* **The Roof Space:** isa fully outfitted 25-person conference room with a panoramic view of Lake Champlain and the Adirondacks. Complete with a small kitchenette, all your A/V needs, a break-out work room and its own bathroom, the Roof Space is an awe inspiring place to host a next meeting or offsite
* **The Side Space:** a flexible, private, 1,200 square foot outdoor green space in our side alleyway. Soaring ivy-lined walls, and low strung festoon lights create an airy, intimate and vibe perfect for classes, workshops or outdoor film nights.

The list of the available options and amenities can vary greatly from event to event but some options include private parking behind the building, event planning and management support, security, and A/V.
