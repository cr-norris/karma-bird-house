        <p>Karma Bird House is a place where curiousities collide. The building includes Maglianero Cafe, Iskra Print Collective, 1% for the Planet, Solidarity of Unbridled Labor, and countless others. Everyday, hundreds of people pass through our doors for a myriad of reasons; a cup of coffee, a printmaking class, non-profit volunteering, or an acupuncture appointment â€“ to name just a few.</p>
        <p>Over 47,000 square feet of space on Burlington's waterfront supports Vermont's creative and business communities. The building has an old world industrial character with beautifully honed wood floors, bold raw beams, exposed brick walls, dramatic ceiling heights and west wall offices with raised decks offering epic lake views. Our dog-friendly spaces range in size from single to three or four person offices, as well as spaces for larger groups. The building is secure and safe with 24 hour digital key card access for anyone leasing a space. Each floor has a buzzing shared common area perfect for a quick meeting or change of scenery from your office.</p>
        <p>Our main entrance is located at the bottom Maple Street between Battery and South Champlain. Stories 1-3 are offices or studios, and the 4 floor is a rooftop conference space available for rent.</p>
