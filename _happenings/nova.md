Suspend your disbelief and climb into the sunset of 2018 at the Karma Bird House for a metamorphic evening filled with warm sights, glowing sounds and dream flavors. Welcome 2019 with an experiment in wellness and wellbeing – let conversation and good karma unfold.

From 7pm–1am a sensory symphony of lights, delights, sounds and sights will reverberate through Maglianero as a series experimental drink offerings test the palette. A transcendent soundscape will transform the room as quiet music plays loudly and loud music quietly — always leaving room for conversation and curiosity.

Good karma only — a new clear, new year.

The symphony be supported by artists including: Greg Davis, Matt Hastings, Lydia Kern, Sage Horsey, Cleo Cello, Wren Kitz, Amelia Devoid, Inspirational United, Oxbow, Solidarity of Unbridled Labor, etc.
