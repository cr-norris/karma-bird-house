Featuring: The Human Fly, Ivamae, Adam Wolf\
$7 at the door

**The Human Fly** is probably indie-soft-rock, but hates that term and is slowly working up to the stage of acceptance.

**Ivamae** combines introspective, catchy verses and sultry R&B inspired vocals over an electric playing style that gently blends R&B, jazz and folk. Visual projections by artist Isaiah Palmeri.

**Adam Wolf**â€™s alt-country sound features heavy guitar and melancholic lyrics, penetrated by the sweeping melodies of a pedal steel. 

Spend time with the people you care about most.
