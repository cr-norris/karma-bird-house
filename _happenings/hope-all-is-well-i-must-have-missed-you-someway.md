Featuring: **The Human Fly** is probably indie-soft-rock, but hates that term and is slowly working up to the stage of acceptance. **Ivamae** combines introspective, catchy verses and sultry R&B inspired vocals over an electric playing style that gently blends R&B, jazz and folk. Visual projections by artist Isaiah Palmeri. **Adam Wolf**â€™s alt-country sound features heavy guitar and melancholic lyrics, penetrated by the sweeping melodies of a pedal steel.

Tickets are $7 and available at the door on the night of the show.
