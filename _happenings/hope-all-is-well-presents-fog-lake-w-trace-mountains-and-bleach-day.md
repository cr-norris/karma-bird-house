<a href="https://foglake.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">**Fog Lake**</a> is lo-fi singer songwriter moniker of Aaron Powell — where he creates music that’s been described as “a complex collage of nebulous angst and heartfelt nostalgia.” Born and raised on the island province of Newfoundland, Canada and in the small rural town of Glovertown (populated by only about 2000 people). Today, Powell lives in Montreal, Quebec writing, recording and playing with his band. His latest full length release entitled Captain was released on July 5th, 2018 via Montreal-based cassette label Stack Your Roster and on vinyl via UK based label Dog Knights Records.
