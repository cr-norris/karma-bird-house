[**Angelo Vasta**](https://www.angelovasta.me/) is an Italian filmmaker and cinematographer based in Brooklyn, New York. He mostly works with dance companies and art institutions, creating short films, behind-the-scenes and promotional videos. Since 2018 he has been a regular contributor for the New York Times (Dance Section) for which he has shot dance companies such as New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, Batsheva, Trisha Brown amongst others.

Vasta is new to drawing, yet he has been building towards these works for years. Throughout his career as a filmmaker he has tuned his eye to color, composition, and movement. Shifting from moving moments to still, he carries a sense of motion—a frame in a moment passing by. Vasta’s work is intrinsically autobiographical, pulling from moments of his daily life and memories; playing a game of backgammon in the living room with his boyfriend, cutting a friend’s hair in the bathroom, or reading a book in the afternoon sun by the Mediterranean Sea. 

Cocooned within a world of carefully considered color palettes and vivid patterns, each drawing evokes a sense of ease, comfort, and intimacy. Scenes of everyday life are potent; rich with warm hues and oil stick marks reaching to the far edges of each page. With each new drawing, Vasta unfolds the experiences he’s accumulated, inviting the viewer in.
