Opening Reception & Performance: Thursday, June 27 at 5â€“8pm\
\
Presented by [Overnight Projects](http://overnightprojects.com/), _Katya Grokhovsky: Privately Owned_ explores privately held desires, concealed traumas, and internal conflicts through works that occupy the space between kitsch and the grotesque. Activating the absurd with anger and cutting humor, Grokhovsky uses sculptural objects, fiber works, video, and performance to analyze domesticity, memory, longing, and femininity. Grokhovsky will present a performance in collaboration with Vermont-based artists at the exhibition opening. 

Born in the Ukraine, raised in Australia, and based in New York, [Katya Grokhovsky](https://www.katyagrokhovsky.net/) is an artist, independent curator, and educator. She is the Founding Artistic Director of The Immigrant Artist Biennial (TIAB) and Feminist Urgent (FU).
