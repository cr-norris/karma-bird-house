_Loose Weave_ is a five day improvisational weaving study on a four harness floor loom by Emma Warren. Over the course of a "work week", Warren set up her studio within the gallery â€“ her large wooden loom, baskets of yarn, stacks of books, plants, and photos from the weaving village of Teotitlan where she has visited. Amongst daily gallery and cafe visitors, Warren wove a site-specific piece.

The loom was dressed with a cotton warp; 7 yards in length by 20 inches wide. The weft consists of cotton, linen, wool, and bamboo yarn in 14 colors. With these materials and framework, the hand interlaces threads to create a woven record of time and place.
