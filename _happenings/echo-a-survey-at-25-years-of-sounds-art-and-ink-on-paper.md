For twenty five years, Burlington's <u> [Iskra Print Collective](https://www.iskraprint.com/) </u> in collaboration with JDK, now <u> [Solidarity of Unbridled Labour](http://solidarityofunbridledlabour.com/) </u>, has been hard at work slinging ink and putting art on paper to produce a collection of hundreds of silkscreen posters for shows at local live music venue <u> [Higher Ground](https://highergroundmusic.com/) <u> – evoking the spirit of each band with bold creativity and providing concert goers with the unique experience of a free commemorative poster at the end of a show.

_**ECHO: A Survey at 25 Years of Sounds, Art and Ink on Paper**_ presents a wide swath of these posters, collectively on display for the first time ever. Accompanying the exhibition and for sale is a newly printed, stunning, high-quality 280 page book filled with all 367 poster designs, ephemera, and anecdotes from the past quarter century. During the book release party, Iskra will be open for a free workshop–join us in learning how these posters are screenprinted and make a print of your own.

The exhibition opening, print workshop, and book release party are being held at the Karma Bird House on Saturday, April 1 from 6:00-9:00pm.
