This one day workshop will introduce beginner dyers to the concepts and practices of natural indigo dyeing. We’ll experiment with dyeing techniques such as dip dye, shibori, and wood block resists. Participants will also leave with instructions and resources for starting and maintaining their own indigo vats. 

The cost of the workshop includes one canvas tote bag for you to dye. You’re welcome and encouraged to bring up to three clean white or off-white items of clothing to dye during the workshop, too.

**Emma Warren** is a textile and clothing designer based in Burlington, Vermont. Her work focuses on small batch and one of a kind goods that are handmade, hand woven and hand dyed using natural materials and environmentally conscious practices. Her exhibit _Loose Weave_ is on view in the gallery until Saturday, October 5.
