The Karma Curiosity Sessions were created as a gathering of the Karma community to get everyone together  to meet each other and get curious about who else is in the Karma Bird House community and what we all do and why â€“ to help collaborations and connections and shared opportunities to learn.

Snacks and drinks will be available. This event is open to all birds, friends of birds, and those that are interested in being birds.
