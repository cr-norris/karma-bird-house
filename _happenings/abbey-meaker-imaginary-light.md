Abbey Meaker’s solo exhibition “Imaginary Light” explores light and shadow, place and time. Glimmering images reflect back memories of time passing — overgrown fields, moss–covered rocks, the last of the autumnal leaves. Working with analog materials Meaker’s work shifts the shape of fleeting light, materializing memory.

[Abbey Meaker](http://abbeymariemeaker.com/) is a lens-based artist, writer, and arts organizer. In November 2019, Meaker founded [Artist Field](https://www.instagram.com/artist_field/), an evolving curatorial platform for research-based artworks & projects that respond to the environment.
